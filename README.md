# kaggle_project_titanic

This project is officially done. Here is a summary of what I have accomplished: 

 1. I have successfully implemented Logistic Regression and a Decision Tree on the Titanic Survivor Database
 that is currently a part of the beginner Kaggle competition located here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. This is all located in the Main file. The other files are for reference as to how I tested and trained the models I used. 
 
 2. I have also done a feature analysis on the data set. This is in FeatureAnalysis file.
